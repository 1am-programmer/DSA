**what is an algorithm?**
An algorithm is a set of well defined instructions to solve a particular problem

**CHARACTERISTICS OF AN ALGORITHM**

1. Input
2. Output
3. Finiteness
4. Definiteness
5. Effectiveness
6. Clear and Unambiguous
7. Language Independent

**ALGORITHM ANALYSIS**
The absolute running time of an algorithm cannot be predicted since it depends on many factors:

1. Programming language used to implement the algorithm.
2. Computer used to run the program
3. Other programs running on the same computer
4. Quality of the compiler used
5. Quality of the operating system

We evaluate the performance of an algorithm in terms of its input size.

1. **Time complexity** : Amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of input size.
2. **Space complexity** : Ammount of memory used by an algorithm to run as a function of input size.

**How to represent complexity**

1. Asymptotic notations:- Mathematical tools used to represent the time and space complexity of an algorithm. They include:

- Big O notation - Worst case Complexity
- Omega notation - Best case Complexity
- Theta notation - Average case Complexity
