## Introduction

In this repository, you'll find notes, code implementations, and various problem-solving approaches related to **Data Structures** and **Algorithms**. 
These are organized into directories based on topics. The purpose of this repository is to understand the underlying principles and to apply them in practice.

## Data Structures

The following data structures are implemented:

- **Arrays**
- **Linked Lists** (Singly, Doubly)
- **Stacks**
- **Queues**
- **Hash Tables**
- **Trees** (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
- **Graphs**
- **Heaps** (Min Heap, Max Heap)
- **Trie**

Each implementation includes:

- An explanation of the data structure
- Code in **[Javascript]**
- Sample usage or test cases

## Algorithms

The repository also contains algorithms, sorted by type:

### Sorting Algorithms

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort

### Searching Algorithms

- Linear Search
- Binary Search

### Dynamic Programming

- Fibonacci Sequence
- Knapsack Problem
- Longest Common Subsequence

### Graph Algorithms

- Depth First Search (DFS)
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- Kruskal’s Algorithm
- Prim’s Algorithm

### Miscellaneous Algorithms

- Greedy Algorithms
- Backtracking Algorithms
