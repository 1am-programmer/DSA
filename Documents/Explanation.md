**BIG O NOTATION**

Big O notation is used to describe the complexity of an algorithm using algebraic terms.
It has two important characteristics

1. It is expressed in terms of the input size.
2. It focuses on the bigger picture without getting caught up in the minute details.

**Types of Big O**

1. O(1) - Linear Time complexity :
   as the input size increases the time taken by the algorithm increases linearly.
