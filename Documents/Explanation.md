**BIG O NOTATION**

Big O notation is used to describe the complexity of an algorithm using algebraic terms.
It has two important characteristics

1. It is expressed in terms of the input size.
2. It focuses on the bigger picture without getting caught up in the minute details.

**Types of Big O**

1. O(n) - Linear Time complexity :
   as the input size increases the time taken by the algorithm increases linearly.
   _Most times if you see a loop in your algorithm, the time complexity is atleast linear_

2. O(1) - Constant Time complexity :
   as the input size increases the time taken by the algorithm remains constant.

3. O(n^2) - Quadratic Time complexity :
   as the input size increases the time taken by the algorithm increases quadratically.
   _Most times if you see a nested loop in your algorithm, the time complexity is quadratic_

- _The Big O drops the less dominant terms_
